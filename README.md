# ProceduralTerrainGeneration
Unity project for procedurally generating terrain/landscape from within the project window

Below are some generated results of this project. The generated results are shown alongside the UI sections for applying different functions. The terrain game object needs to hold the TerrainS script in its script component for the user to be able to access and use the UI. It appears under the script component that belongs to the terrain game object. For each implemented function, a different foldout menu is created from which the user can adjust the values of the parameters that are used for each function. Adjusting the values for parameters will help the user tune how the resulting terrain is generated. A button exists in each foldout to apply the function with the adjusted parameters. There also exists a checkbox at the top part of the set up UI which gives the user the choice to reset the terrain or not before applying any function.
